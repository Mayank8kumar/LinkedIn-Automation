Software Engineer,"About the job
At Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Master your toolkit. By working across diverse tech stacks, you’ll refine your ability to choose the right tools for every challenge. From monolithic to microservices architectures, gRPC to REST APIs, Kubernetes to Docker, Python to Rust—you’ll show that true expertise isn’t about using the trendiest technologies, but about understanding their purpose to unleash their full potential.
Build stuff that matters. Regardless of your seniority, you’ll enjoy plenty of autonomy and take full ownership of your work, from ideation to execution. You’ll have the unique opportunity to build software from the ground up and witness firsthand how your code evolves into a product used at scale.
Simplify relentlessly. Is every component essential? Do we need this process? As a Bending Spoons engineer, your mission is to turn complexity into simplicity. Whether optimizing CI/CD pipelines, writing maintainable code, or crafting minimalist architectures, your drive to simplify will power scalable, future-proof solutions.

What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.

What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.

Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK) or remote.

Before you apply
Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We're extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don't hesitate to apply.

The selection process
If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested through this form.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

EXPERIENCE: 1-4 Yrs
LOCATION: GURGAON

Company Overview:
Ferns N Petals (FNP) is India’s leading gifting and celebration platform — a household name that has redefined how people express love, gratitude, and emotion. With a legacy of 30 years, we’ve grown from a single flower shop in Delhi to a global gifting brand serving over 320 cities in India and 57 countries worldwide.

But what truly sets us apart is our constant evolution.

We are no longer just about delivering flowers and cakes. We are building an ecosystem for celebrations — from birthdays and anniversaries to festive gifting, weddings, corporate events, and everything in between. Our offerings today span personalized products, gourmet hampers, plants, digital experiences, home décor, and much more.

We are trusted by millions, but we believe this is just Day One of a much bigger story.


Who are we looking for?
We're looking for builders, not just coders. Engineers who care about why something is being built, not just how. People who obsess over clean abstractions, scalable systems, and performance — but who also get excited about improving conversion rates, launch velocity, and customer experience.

You’re someone who thrives in ambiguity, questions assumptions, and believes in shipping fast without compromising quality. You understand that tech is a product lever, not a backend function. You take ownership of outcomes, not just code commits. If you’re passionate about solving real-world problems at scale — and want to play a pivotal role in reinventing the tech behind a category-defining brand — we’d love to talk.



Key Responsibilities:
We’re looking for engineers who’ve worked with modern, high-performance tech stacks and can contribute to building scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems for fast-growing digital businesses. Experience in e-commerce, fintech, gaming, or any high-scale consumer-tech environment is a strong plus.

Core Engineering Skills [Must Have]
Languages: Proficiency in modern languages like Go, Java, or Node.js. Understanding of concurrency, memory optimization, and performance tuning is expected.
Databases: Strong experience with NoSQL systems like MongoDB, DynamoDB, and knowledge of relational databases when appropriate. You understand when to use what.
Streaming & Caching: Experience with Kafka, Redis, RabbitMQ, or similar for building event-driven, real-time pipelines.
Search Systems: Familiarity with Elasticsearch or Apache Solr for building intelligent, fast, and relevant product discovery experiences.

Frontend & App Technologies [Good To have]
Web Frameworks: Solid hands-on experience in React.js, Angular, or similar frameworks.
Modern Frontend Stacks: Familiarity with Next.js, Gatsby, or similar SSR/SSG frameworks for SEO-first, high-performance frontend experiences.
Mobile: Experience in React Native, Flutter, or building native apps is a plus.
SEO & Performance: Understanding of Core Web Vitals, performance budgeting, and rendering strategies that impact business outcomes.

Cloud, DevOps, and Scale [Good to have]
Cloud Platforms: Production experience with GCP, AWS, or similar cloud providers.
Content Delivery: Working knowledge of CDNs (like Cloudflare, Akamai) and caching strategies to deliver performant global experiences.
Security & Compliance: Awareness of secure coding practices, rate limiting, API protection, and platform reliability.

Product, AI, and Data-Driven Thinking [Big Plus]
Exposure to AI/ML tooling, recommendation engines, or personalization frameworks is a big plus.
Strong product intuition and ability to work closely with PMs and Designers to align on outcomes.
A builder’s mindset — you care about business impact, not just finishing sprints.


Tech Leadership:
Our CTO Saurav Singh is a seasoned technology leader with over a decade of experience scaling high-impact e-commerce platforms. At Zomato, he led critical engineering efforts to scale marketplace and order management systems that supported millions of daily transactions, ensuring high reliability and fast feature delivery. His leadership helped unlock rapid growth by driving alignment between product vision and engineering execution.

As Head of Engineering and Product for District by Zomato, Saurav spearheaded the creation of new verticals, managing the integration of legacy and modern systems to deliver seamless, scalable solutions. Known for combining deep technical expertise with strong product thinking, he focuses on outcomes that improve both customer experience and business metrics.
