Graduate Software Engineer,"About the job
At Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Master your toolkit. By working across diverse tech stacks, you’ll refine your ability to choose the right tools for every challenge. From monolithic to microservices architectures, gRPC to REST APIs, Kubernetes to Docker, Python to Rust—you’ll show that true expertise isn’t about using the trendiest technologies, but about understanding their purpose to unleash their full potential.
Build stuff that matters. Regardless of your seniority, you’ll enjoy plenty of autonomy and take full ownership of your work, from ideation to execution. You’ll have the unique opportunity to build software from the ground up and witness firsthand how your code evolves into a product used at scale.
Simplify relentlessly. Is every component essential? Do we need this process? As a Bending Spoons engineer, your mission is to turn complexity into simplicity. Whether optimizing CI/CD pipelines, writing maintainable code, or crafting minimalist architectures, your drive to simplify will power scalable, future-proof solutions.

What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.

What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.

Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK) or remote.

Before you apply
Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We're extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don't hesitate to apply.

The selection process
If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested through this form.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

Frontend Developer,"About the job
About us 

We are Kraftshala. We are an online skilling institution committed to playing the long game of building a transformative educational experience for the masses. We call this ‘Scaling with Soul’. 

Scaling with Soul, to us, means we always prioritise student outcomes– specifically our Placement Rate (percentage of students placed)- over other metrics, such as number of enrolments or company valuation in the coming year. 

This is, of course, easier said than done. There are painful choices to be made at every stage, from admissions to training to placements, that wouldn’t have been needed were we willing to give up on either of high quality or scale. 

But in the long run, we believe that our obsession over these student outcomes will earn Kraftshala the trust of Indian students, their families, recruiters and the broader ecosystem. 

That’s why we make each of our Placement Reports public, capturing how many students are placed in each batch, in what companies, at what salaries etc. 

We don’t need to. None of our competitors do (though we’d be happy to be proven wrong and have more educators join us!). Simply put, we have tasted the benefits of an education model grounded in high quality paired with the transparency of student outcomes and now cannot imagine doing it any other way.

We are not the largest in terms of enrollments. Nowhere close, actually. Not yet. 

However, we are proud to be one of the largest, if not the largest already, in terms of actual, verifiable placements. 

And in terms of Placement Rate, the metric that matters most to us, we are the absolute best in edtech. In the last 4 years, we have placed more than 2000+ students with a Placement Rate of 94% (and improving). 

This is our long game- to Scale with Soul. We invite you to join us for the play.  

Funding:

Kraftshala is backed by a number of eminent investors, including: 

Phanindra Sama and Sudhakar Pasupunuri, co-founders at Redbus and early investors in unicorns like Unacademy
Amit Kumar Agarwal, Saurabh Garg and Akhil Gupta, co-founders at Nobroker.com (the world’s largest NoBrokerage Property Site and India’s first realty startup unicorn)
Sujayathi Ali, Co-founder at ShopUp and Voonik
Doreswamy Nandkishore (Former Fortune 100 CEO, Head of Asia, Oceania, Africa for Nestlé S.A. and Professor, ISB) 
Pallav Jain and Sarfaraz Khimani (co-CEOs of Performics, India's largest SEO/ performance marketing agencies) 

What do we value (the Kraftshala Kode):

Kraftshala is on a mission to become the largest career launchpad in the world. 

Team Kraftshala is for the ambitious, the forever-learners, and most of all, for those who live to add value to others. In a world where education companies often lose sight of their core, we aim to Scale with Soul, to offer greater value to each stakeholder (including our team) everyday we get bigger. 

Joining Kraftshala now means becoming part of a story still in its early chapters- one you’ll help shape with your ideas, actions, and leadership. Here are things we care for: 

We seek a value-adding mindset in prospective team mates. Folks who demonstrate a capacity to understand their users' needs and are willing to go the extra mile to deliver on that, fit right in. 
We value problem solving skills. We look at problems objectively, work backwards from the user, solve for root causes and optimise for their long-term good instead of our short-term gain. We don’t let processes or hierarchies get in the way of adding value. 
We believe speed matters enormously in business. We value people who move with urgency, have a bias for action and are willing to take calculated risks in the face of uncertainty. 
We look for people with high learning agility, those truth seekers who pursue the best data, ideas, and solutions with rigour and open mindedness, and are constantly working to become better today than yesterday. 
We admire people with ambition & courage to take on large goals. We are seeking to build a team of self-starters who demonstrate high ownership. 
We aim for consistency and reliability and expect the same from others. Predictability just makes everyone’s life a lot smoother. 
We believe people who demonstrate candour with care are the most effective: real, open and direct in communication, while still being highly empathetic. 
We have learnt that Scaling with Soul requires frugality. Resource constraints help sharpen focus and breed inventiveness. 
We are practical optimists. Our team strongly believes in a better future and takes joy and pride in the fact that we are playing our part to make that future a reality.

As part of the Frontend Developer role at Kraftshala, you would be conducting technical feasibility analyses, and writing clean, scalable, and reusable code.

Must Haves:

2-3 years of experience in building web applications in React & Redux, Gatsby, Netlify, HTML5, CSS3. (We are not too fussed about the number of years. Experience is simply a proxy for capability, which is what we really care for)

Ability to write efficient, secure, well-documented and clean JavaScript code.
Strong product design sensibilities and obsessive attention to detail.

Graduate Software Engineer,"About the job
At Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Master your toolkit. By working across diverse tech stacks, you’ll refine your ability to choose the right tools for every challenge. From monolithic to microservices architectures, gRPC to REST APIs, Kubernetes to Docker, Python to Rust—you’ll show that true expertise isn’t about using the trendiest technologies, but about understanding their purpose to unleash their full potential.
Build stuff that matters. Regardless of your seniority, you’ll enjoy plenty of autonomy and take full ownership of your work, from ideation to execution. You’ll have the unique opportunity to build software from the ground up and witness firsthand how your code evolves into a product used at scale.
Simplify relentlessly. Is every component essential? Do we need this process? As a Bending Spoons engineer, your mission is to turn complexity into simplicity. Whether optimizing CI/CD pipelines, writing maintainable code, or crafting minimalist architectures, your drive to simplify will power scalable, future-proof solutions.

What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.

What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £66,779 in the UK and €63,965 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £149,636 in the UK, and €105,737 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.

Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK) or remote.

Before you apply
Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We're extremely ambitious and we ask a lot of ourselves and one another. While this tends to lead to fantastic learning, achievements, and career growth, it also requires a significant commitment. So if you like the role and are ready to give your very best, don't hesitate to apply.

The selection process
If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.

Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested through this form.

Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.
